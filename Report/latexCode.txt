\section*{Abstract}
This report presents the design and analysis of a geometric algorithm project. The focus is on implementing various geometric algorithms with different Big Oh complexities to address fundamental problems in computational geometry. The system allows users to specify the number of inputs, generating computer-generated points for algorithmic exploration. Emphasis is placed on a user-friendly interface with visually appealing and informative representations. The report details design, implementation steps, interface considerations, and insights into time and space complexities.

\section*{Introduction}
Geometric algorithms play a crucial role in computer science. This project concentrates on line segment intersection and convex hull construction, employing conventional and cutting-edge approaches. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly platform for interactive exploration of geometric algorithms.

\section*{Programming Design}
The web-based project employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive interface for visualizing geometric algorithms. Users can select an algorithm, input the number of points, and observe the system generate and construct a convex hull. Implementation includes the d3.js library and Bootstrap framework for enhanced GUI, featuring neon effects for aesthetic appeal. Figure~\ref{fig:system-architecture} illustrates the system architecture, seamlessly integrating these components. JavaScript manages user interactions, algorithm execution, and visualization speed, ensuring a cohesive and visually engaging platform.
